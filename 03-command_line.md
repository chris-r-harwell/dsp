### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

Assume bash shell.
```pwd`` prints the working directory
```mkdir``` creates a directory
```rmdir or rm -rf``` removes a directory, the latter if not empty and forces it.
```touch myfile.txt``` will create an empty file named touch if not present already, otherwise it will update the timestamp.
```rm file``` will remove a file
```mv oldname newname``` will rename a file named oldname to newname.
```ls -a``` will list files that were hidden may starting their name with a dot.
```cp ~/onedir/foo ~/anotherdir/`` will copy the file named foo from the directory named onedir underneath the home directory to one named anotherdir underneath the home directory.
```ps -elf f``` will list the processes in a nice tree format.
```find / -name 'yo*'``` will find a file whose name starts with yo.
