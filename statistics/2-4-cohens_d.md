Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4
 effect size of Cohen's d

Cohen's D is an example of effect size. Other examples of effect size are:
    correlation between two variables,
    mean difference,
    regression coefficients and
    standardized test statistics such as: t, Z, F ...
In this example, you will compute Cohen's D to quantify (or measure) the
difference between two groups of data.

You will see effect size again and again in results of algorithms that
are run in data science. For instance, in the bootcamp, when you run a
regression analysis, you will recognize the t-statistic as an example of
effect size.

Exercise 4:
    Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are
    lighter or heaver than others. Compute Cohen's d to quantify the
    difference between groups.
    How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?

## <a name="section-c">3) Explanation</a>

Both insignificant. It looks as if neither the total weight or the pregnancy length is appreciably skewed between first and other births.  The total weight is ever so slightly less for first births than it is for others, indicated by a negative sign for Cohen's d.  The effect of birth order is even smaller for length of pregnancy, being ever so slightly shorter for first births, indicated by a positive Cohen's d.
